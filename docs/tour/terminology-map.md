# Terminology map

Harmonograf reuses words from several neighboring worlds — ADK,
OpenTelemetry, general agent-framework discourse — and sometimes gives
them slightly different meanings. This page maps harmonograf vocabulary
to the vocabulary you may already carry in from elsewhere, so you can
translate without having to relearn.

If you are coming in cold with no prior vocabulary, skip this page and
read [mental-model.md](mental-model.md) instead.

## The primitives, at a glance

```mermaid
graph TD
    Session[Session<br/>one agent rollout] --> Agent[Agent<br/>one actor]
    Session --> Plan[Plan<br/>DAG of tasks]
    Agent --> Span[Span<br/>event with duration]
    Plan --> Task[Task<br/>unit of work]
    Task -.bound_span_id.-> Span
    Span -.payload_refs.-> Payload[Payload<br/>content-addressed bytes]
    Span -.links.-> Span
    Plan -.refine on drift.-> Plan
    Session --> Annotation[Annotation<br/>human note]
    Session --> ControlEvent[ControlEvent<br/>frontend->agent]
    Session --> SessionState[session.state<br/>harmonograf.* keys]
    SessionState -.read by.-> Agent
    Agent -.reporting tools.-> Task
    ControlEvent -.ack upstream.-> Span
```

Read the diagram as "these are the nouns and how they reference each
other on the wire". The dashed arrows are indirect relationships (by id
rather than by containment). The plan-refine self-loop is the dynamic
part: drift produces a revised plan, which supersedes the previous one.

## ADK terms → harmonograf terms

If you've been building on Google's Agent Development Kit, most of the
concepts line up cleanly — harmonograf was designed around ADK first.

```mermaid
graph LR
    subgraph ADK
        ADK_Session[Session]
        ADK_Agent[sub-agent]
        ADK_Callback[before_model_callback<br/>after_model_callback<br/>on_event_callback]
        ADK_Tool[function tool]
        ADK_State[session.state dict]
        ADK_Event[Event]
    end

    subgraph Harmonograf
        HG_Session[Session]
        HG_Agent[Agent]
        HG_Span[Span telemetry]
        HG_Tool[reporting tools]
        HG_State[harmonograf.* keys]
        HG_Task[Task state machine]
    end

    ADK_Session --> HG_Session
    ADK_Agent --> HG_Agent
    ADK_Callback --> HG_Span
    ADK_Tool --> HG_Tool
    ADK_State --> HG_State
    ADK_Event --> HG_Task
```

In prose:

- **ADK `Session` → harmonograf `Session`.** Same thing, same id.
- **ADK sub-agent → harmonograf `Agent`.** One ADK sub-agent = one
  harmonograf agent row on the Gantt.
- **ADK callbacks → harmonograf spans.** Every
  `before_model_callback` / `after_model_callback` / `before_tool_callback`
  fires a span emission. Harmonograf attaches to these callbacks via
  `HarmonografAdkPlugin`.
- **ADK function tools → harmonograf reporting tools.** The seven
  `report_*` tools are ordinary ADK function tools; harmonograf
  intercepts them in `before_tool_callback` to apply state transitions.
  An agent calls them just like any other tool.
- **ADK `session.state` dict → harmonograf `session.state` with
  `harmonograf.*` keys.** Harmonograf reserves the `harmonograf.`
  prefix; everything else is untouched.
- **ADK events → harmonograf drift signals.** `on_event_callback`
  watches for `transfer`, `escalate`, and `state_delta` events as
  belt-and-suspenders drift signals.
- **What ADK does NOT have: an explicit task state machine, a plan DAG,
  drift kinds, refines, a canonical cross-agent timeline, or a
  bidirectional coordination channel.** Those are what harmonograf
  adds on top.

For the deep ADK integration details see
[docs/dev-guide/client-library.md](../dev-guide/client-library.md) and
[docs/design/12-client-library-and-adk.md](../design/12-client-library-and-adk.md).

## OpenTelemetry terms → harmonograf terms

Distributed-tracing terminology is a trap: the words are familiar but
the semantics diverge in critical places.

```mermaid
graph LR
    subgraph OpenTelemetry
        OT_Trace[Trace]
        OT_Span[Span]
        OT_Attr[attribute]
        OT_Link[Link]
        OT_Event[Span Event]
        OT_Resource[Resource]
    end

    subgraph Harmonograf
        HG_Session2[Session]
        HG_Span2[Span telemetry only]
        HG_Attr[attribute]
        HG_SpanLink[SpanLink]
        HG_Task2[Task state machine<br/>NOT inferred from span lifecycle]
        HG_Agent2[Agent]
    end

    OT_Trace --> HG_Session2
    OT_Span --> HG_Span2
    OT_Attr --> HG_Attr
    OT_Link --> HG_SpanLink
    OT_Event -.does NOT map.-> HG_Task2
    OT_Resource --> HG_Agent2
```

Where OTel and harmonograf line up:

- **OTel trace ↔ harmonograf session.** One trace = one session.
- **OTel span ↔ harmonograf span.** Same shape: id, parent_id, kind,
  name, start, end, attributes, links.
- **OTel attributes ↔ harmonograf attributes.** `AttributeValue`
  supports the same primitive types.
- **OTel link ↔ harmonograf `SpanLink`.** Same cross-trace / cross-span
  causality edge.
- **OTel resource ↔ harmonograf `Agent`.** A "resource" in OTel is the
  process emitting spans; a harmonograf agent is the equivalent scope.

Where they diverge — and where the divergence matters:

- **OTel infers "task state" from span lifecycle. Harmonograf does
  not.** In OTel, a finished span means an operation finished. In
  harmonograf, a finished span means a piece of telemetry finished; the
  task state is tracked separately via the reporting tools, precisely
  because span lifecycle gets task state wrong in multi-agent
  rollouts. This is the central architectural bet — see
  [docs/overview.md](../overview.md) for the motivation.
- **OTel has no concept of a plan.** Harmonograf's plan layer
  (`TaskPlan`, `Task`, `TaskEdge`) has no OTel analogue. A plan is not
  an otel thing.
- **OTel has no concept of drift or refine.** There is no OTel
  primitive that says "the plan changed". You'd have to bolt it on.
- **OTel has no bidirectional channel.** OTel is emit-only. Harmonograf's
  `SubscribeControl` has no OTel equivalent.
- **OTel spans can be re-parented / retroactively edited. Harmonograf
  spans are append-only once started.** See
  [docs/protocol/span-lifecycle.md](../protocol/span-lifecycle.md).

Practical advice: if you find yourself thinking "but in OTel we'd...",
pause and check whether the OTel instinct is driving you back toward
span-inferred state. That's the trap.

## Agent-framework terms → harmonograf terms

Every agent framework has its own vocabulary. Here is a rough map.

```mermaid
graph LR
    subgraph "CrewAI / agent frameworks"
        Crew[Crew]
        Member[Crew member]
        CrewTask[Task]
        Process[Process sequential/hierarchical/parallel]
    end

    subgraph "LangGraph"
        Graph[StateGraph]
        Node[Node]
        Edge[Edge]
        Checkpoint[Checkpoint]
    end

    subgraph "Supervisor patterns"
        Supervisor[Supervisor]
        Worker[Worker]
        Handoff[Handoff]
    end

    subgraph Harmonograf
        HG_Session3[Session]
        HG_Agent3[Agent]
        HG_Task3[Task in a Plan]
        HG_Mode[Orchestration mode:<br/>sequential/parallel/delegated]
        HG_State2[session.state]
        HG_Transfer[TRANSFER span]
    end

    Crew --> HG_Session3
    Member --> HG_Agent3
    CrewTask --> HG_Task3
    Process --> HG_Mode

    Graph --> HG_Session3
    Node --> HG_Agent3
    Edge --> HG_Transfer
    Checkpoint --> HG_State2

    Supervisor --> HG_Agent3
    Worker --> HG_Agent3
    Handoff --> HG_Transfer
```

Key correspondences:

- **Crew / graph / supervisor "container" → harmonograf `Session`.**
  Whatever top-level object your framework uses to bundle agents, it
  maps onto a session.
- **Crew member / graph node / worker → harmonograf `Agent`.**
- **Crew task / graph node-as-task / worker assignment → harmonograf
  `Task`.** Note the distinction: harmonograf separates the *agent*
  (who does the work) from the *task* (what work is done), even though
  in some frameworks they're fused.
- **Process mode (sequential / hierarchical / parallel) → harmonograf
  orchestration mode (`sequential` / `delegated` / `parallel`).**
  Harmonograf's parallel mode uses a rigid-DAG walker with a
  forced-task-id ContextVar; see
  [docs/protocol/task-state-machine.md](../protocol/task-state-machine.md).
- **Handoff / transfer / delegation → harmonograf `TRANSFER` span,
  plus a cross-agent `SpanLink`.** Transfers are the things that
  originate the bezier curves on the Gantt view between agent rows.
- **Checkpoint / shared memory → harmonograf `session.state` with the
  `harmonograf.*` keys.**

If your framework doesn't have an explicit plan-versus-execution split,
expect harmonograf's plan layer to feel unfamiliar at first. The
mental-model page walks through it step by step:
[mental-model.md](mental-model.md).

## UI vocabulary

The frontend has a few words that don't map onto the backend primitives
one-to-one. Here are the ones that trip people up:

| UI term | Backend primitive | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **Sessions view** | the Gantt view | The nav rail calls the main view "Sessions"; everywhere else it's called "Gantt". Same page. |
| **Row** | an `Agent` | One row per agent. |
| **Bar** | a `Span` | Color = span kind, fill pattern = status. |
| **Ghost bar** | a predicted span from a `Task` (dashed, 30% opacity) | The planner's prediction; replaced by a real bar once the task actually runs. |
| **Breathing bar** | a running span | 2-second pulse animation while `end_time` is null. |
| **Cross-agent edge** | a `SpanLink` of kind transfer | Bezier curve between two bars on different rows. |
| **Plan-revision banner** | a refine result | Appears when a new plan revision arrives. |
| **Plan-diff drawer** | the diff against the previous revision | Shows added / removed / reordered / re-parented / re-assigned tasks. |
| **Current task strip** | the task currently bound to the active span in the focused agent | Reads `harmonograf.current_task_id` from `session.state`. |
| **Live-tail cursor** | server's `latest_span_time` per session | The right-edge follower on the Gantt. |
| **Transport bar** | frontend control emitting `SendControl` events | Pause / resume / follow-live / zoom. |
| **Inspector drawer** | the `GetSpanTree` or task-specific data for the selection | Tabs: Summary, Task, Payload, Timeline, Links, Annotations, Control. |
| **Attention badge** | computed by the server's liveness tracker | Highlights stuck / slow agents on the session picker. |

For the full UI reference see
[docs/user-guide/index.md](../user-guide/index.md). For keyboard
shortcuts specifically,

## Common false friends

A short list of terms that sound the same in two worlds but mean
different things.

- **"Event"**. In OTel, a point-in-time annotation on a span. In ADK,
  a message on the event stream. In harmonograf, a control event. Three
  different concepts. Always prefix the term with the world you're in.
- **"State"**. In ADK, `session.state` is a mutable dict. In
  harmonograf, "task state" is the monotonic state machine
  (`PENDING → RUNNING → COMPLETED/FAILED`). The two are unrelated
  except that harmonograf happens to write some of its task context
  into ADK's state dict.
- **"Plan"**. In some frameworks, a plan is an LLM's chain-of-thought
  scratchpad. In harmonograf, a plan is a structured DAG artifact with
  an id, a revision, and stored tasks and edges.
- **"Task"**. In OTel, often a synonym for span. In harmonograf, a
  task is an object in the plan layer, completely disjoint from any
  span.
- **"Transfer"**. In ADK, a sub-agent handoff. In harmonograf, a span
  with kind `TRANSFER`, which is exactly the same underlying operation
  — the vocabulary agrees here.
- **"Ack"**. In most RPC systems, a per-message ack on whatever stream
  sent the message. In harmonograf, control events ride down on
  `SubscribeControl` but their acks ride **upstream** on
  `StreamTelemetry`, for happens-before ordering with spans. See
  [docs/protocol/wire-ordering.md](../protocol/wire-ordering.md).
