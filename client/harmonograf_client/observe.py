"""Explicit observability-only helper for goldfive Runners.

``harmonograf_client.observe(runner)`` attaches a :class:`HarmonografSink`
to an existing :class:`goldfive.Runner`. It does **not** modify planning,
steering, goal derivation, or execution — those concerns belong to
``goldfive.wrap``. The two responsibilities stay crystal-clear::

    import goldfive
    import harmonograf_client

    runner = harmonograf_client.observe(goldfive.wrap(root_agent))
    outcome = await runner.run("make a presentation about waffles")

See issue #22 for the motivation.

    """Attach a :class:`HarmonografSink` to ``runner`` and return it.

    This helper is observability-only: it registers a
    :class:`HarmonografSink` via ``runner.add_sink(...)`` and wires a
    :class:`ControlBridge` so pause / resume / cancel / steer / rewind
    issued from the harmonograf UI reach the live runner. It never
    touches the planner, steerer, executor, goal deriver, or any other
    orchestration component.

    ``observe()`` must be called from within a running asyncio event
    loop — the bridge needs a loop to consume events on, and the
    bridge's teardown is registered as a :meth:`Runner.add_close_hook`
    so ``runner.close()`` tears the wire down cleanly.

    Parameters
    ----------
    runner:
        An existing :class:`goldfive.Runner`, typically produced by
        :func:`goldfive.wrap`.
    client:
        Optional pre-built :class:`Client` to reuse (e.g. shared across
        multiple runners). When omitted, a new ``Client`` is constructed
        from ``name`` / ``framework`` / ``server_addr``.
    name:
        Client display name. Defaults to ``"agent"``. Ignored when
        ``client`` is provided.
    framework:
        Client framework tag (shown in the UI). Defaults to
        ``"CUSTOM"``. Ignored when ``client`` is provided.
    server_addr:
        Harmonograf server address. When omitted, reads the
        ``HARMONOGRAF_SERVER`` environment variable; falls back to
        ``Client``'s own default (``127.0.0.1:7531``). Ignored when
        ``client`` is provided.
    install_adk_telemetry:
        When ``True`` (default), best-effort install
        :class:`HarmonografTelemetryPlugin` on the runner so ADK
        lifecycle callbacks turn into harmonograf spans. The install is
        skipped silently when the runner doesn't carry an
        ``add_plugin`` hook (e.g. a non-ADK runner) and any failure is
        DEBUG-logged rather than raised — a broken telemetry install
        must never break the surrounding ``observe`` call.

    Returns
    -------
    The same ``runner`` object (mutated), so callers can chain the two
    idiomatic calls on one line::

        runner = harmonograf_client.observe(goldfive.wrap(agent))

    Notes
    -----
    Calling ``observe`` twice on the same runner appends two sinks.
    That's deliberate — the caller is responsible for deciding whether
    deduping makes sense in their context. Attaching a second bridge to
    the same runner will raise from goldfive's ``control`` setter since
    a channel is already attached — callers who want multiple observers
    should share a single ``Client``+bridge pair instead.
